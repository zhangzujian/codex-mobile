### Feature: Disable auto-restore to last thread when opening home URL

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one existing thread is available.
- Browser local storage may contain previous app state.

#### Steps
1. Open an existing thread route and confirm messages are visible.
2. Open `http://localhost:<port>/` (home route) in the same browser profile.
3. Refresh the home route once.
4. Close and re-open the app/tab at the home URL again.

#### Expected Results
- The app remains on the home/new-thread screen and does not auto-navigate to `/thread/<id>`.
- Refreshing home still keeps the user on home.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.
