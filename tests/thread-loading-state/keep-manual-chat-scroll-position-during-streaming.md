### Feature: Keep manual chat scroll position during streaming

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with enough history to allow scrolling away from bottom.

#### Steps
1. Open the thread and scroll upward so latest messages are not visible.
2. Send a new message that produces a streaming assistant response.
3. During streaming, do not scroll and observe viewport position.
4. After streaming completes, verify the viewport remains at the same manual position.

#### Expected Results
- Streaming updates do not force auto-scroll to the bottom when user has manually scrolled away.
- User can continue reading older history while the response streams.
- If the thread is already at the bottom when streaming starts, the latest streaming overlay remains visible.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert the scroll-preservation change in `src/components/content/ThreadConversation.vue` if manual scroll locking needs to be removed.
