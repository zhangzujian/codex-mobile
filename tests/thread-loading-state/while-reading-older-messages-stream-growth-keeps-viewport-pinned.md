### Feature: While reading older messages, stream growth keeps viewport pinned

#### Prerequisites
- Start app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Open a long thread and scroll up away from bottom.

#### Steps
1. Keep viewport fixed on an older message section.
2. Trigger a long assistant response so content height grows continuously.
3. Observe viewport position for 10-20 seconds during streaming.

#### Expected Results
- Viewport stays pinned at the same absolute scroll location while streaming.
- No gradual downward drift occurs until user manually jumps to latest/bottom.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.
