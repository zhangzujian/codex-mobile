### Feature: Thread auto-scrolls to latest message after load

#### Prerequisites
- Start app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have a thread with enough messages to require scrolling.

#### Steps
1. Open the long thread from the sidebar.
2. Wait for `Loading messages...` to disappear.
3. Observe the conversation viewport position immediately after load.
4. Switch to another thread, then back to the same long thread.

#### Expected Results
- After each thread load, conversation snaps to the bottom-most/latest message.
- The latest message is visible without manual scrolling.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.
