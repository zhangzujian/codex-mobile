### Thread conversation loads earlier turns on demand

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread conversation incremental older-turn loading.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`)
2. A thread with more than 10 turns is available
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open a thread that has more than 10 turns.
2. Confirm the newest messages render first and the conversation shows the Load earlier messages control at the top.
3. Click Load earlier messages once.
4. Confirm an older batch is prepended above the previously first visible turn and the scroll position stays near the same content.
5. Continue clicking Load earlier messages until the control disappears.
6. Confirm the oldest messages in the thread are visible and no duplicate message rows are introduced.
7. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-6 on the same thread or another long thread.

#### Expected Results
- Initial thread open remains bounded to the latest turn page.
- Load earlier messages fetches older persisted turns from the local bridge instead of only revealing already-loaded messages.
- The control remains available while older persisted turns exist and disappears after the first turn is loaded.
- Message ordering, turn actions, and scroll restoration remain stable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.
