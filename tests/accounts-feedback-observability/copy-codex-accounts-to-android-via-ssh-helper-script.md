### Feature: Copy Codex accounts to Android via ssh helper script

#### Prerequisites
- Local Codex state exists at `~/.codex/accounts` and `~/.codex/accounts.json`.
- Android helper exists and is executable: `/Users/igor/Git-projects/codex-web-local-android/andclaw/ssh.sh`.
- Android target is reachable through helper SSH path.

#### Steps
1. Run `scripts/copy-accounts-to-android.sh`.
2. Confirm script prints local account count and upload/extract progress.
3. Confirm script prints remote account count.
4. Verify script exits successfully with `Copy complete: local and remote counts match.`
5. On Android host, verify `~/.codex/accounts.json` exists and snapshots under `~/.codex/accounts/*/auth.json` are present.

#### Expected Results
- Script packs `accounts/` and `accounts.json`, uploads and extracts on Android.
- Local and remote `auth.json` snapshot counts match.
- Script exits non-zero on mismatch or missing prerequisites.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove remote copied data if needed: delete `~/.codex/accounts` and `~/.codex/accounts.json` on Android host.
