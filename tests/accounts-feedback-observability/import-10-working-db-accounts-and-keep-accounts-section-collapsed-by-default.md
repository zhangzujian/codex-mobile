### Feature: Import 10 working DB accounts and keep Accounts section collapsed by default

#### Prerequisites
- Have a SQLite DB with `account_tokens.refresh_token` rows (default path: `/Users/igor/Git-projects/any-auto-register/account_manager.db`).
- Network access available for token exchange against OpenAI OAuth endpoint.
- Codex home available at `~/.codex` (or set `CODEX_HOME`).
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).

#### Steps
1. Run `scripts/import-working-accounts-from-db.sh`.
2. Verify script reports `imported` rows and ends with `done imported=<n>` where `n <= 10`.
3. Open `~/.codex/accounts.json` and verify new account entries were appended/updated.
4. Verify snapshot files exist under `~/.codex/accounts/<sha256(account_id)>/auth.json`.
5. Open app settings and check the `Accounts` section is collapsed on first load.
6. Click the chevron toggle in Accounts header to expand.
7. Confirm account list/error/empty state renders correctly after expanding.
8. Reload the page and confirm collapsed/expanded state persists.

#### Expected Results
- Script imports up to 10 valid (token-exchange-successful) accounts and skips invalid tokens.
- `accounts.json` and per-account snapshot `auth.json` files are created with secure file modes.
- Accounts panel in settings is collapsed by default when no saved preference exists.
- User can expand/collapse Accounts via header toggle, and the state persists in localStorage.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove imported snapshots from `~/.codex/accounts/` and corresponding rows in `~/.codex/accounts.json` if needed.
- Delete localStorage key `codex-web-local.accounts-section-collapsed.v1` to reset UI preference.
