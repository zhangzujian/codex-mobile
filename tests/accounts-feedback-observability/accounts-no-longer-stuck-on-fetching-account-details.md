### Feature: Accounts no longer stuck on "Fetching account details…"

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have at least one imported account in the Accounts section.

#### Steps
1. Open Settings and expand `Accounts`.
2. Ensure at least one account has no immediately available quota snapshot (for example right after import/refresh, or by waiting for quota read failure).
3. Observe the quota/status line for that account after the initial fetch completes.
4. Trigger `Reload` in the Accounts header and wait for account list update.
5. Re-check accounts that are not in `Loading quota…` state.

#### Expected Results
- `Fetching account details…` appears only while the entry is truly in transient loading.
- Accounts that are not loading and still have no quota snapshot show `Quota unavailable` instead of a perpetual fetching label.
- Existing `Loading quota…` and explicit error messages continue to render correctly.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.
