### TestChat GLM-5 new-thread model selection

#### Feature/Change Name
New TestChat threads use the provider-scoped model selected in the new-thread composer.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Custom endpoint provider configured for `http://127.0.0.1:8666/v1`
3. Custom endpoint API format set to `Completions`
4. The local endpoint advertises model `glm-5`

#### Steps
1. Open the app home page
2. Select project `TestChat`
3. Select model `glm-5` in the new-thread composer
4. Send `create todo list app`
5. Inspect the created session metadata or UI model selector for the new thread

#### Expected Results
- The new thread starts with model `glm-5`, not the previous model from another provider or context
- The running turn uses the custom endpoint completions proxy
- The UI keeps `glm-5` selected after the thread is created

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider/model settings back to preferred defaults if needed
