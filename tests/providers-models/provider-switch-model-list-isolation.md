### Provider Switch Model List Isolation

#### Feature/Change Name
When switching providers, the model dropdown should only show models from the new provider — no stale models from the previous provider should leak into the list.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Access to at least two providers (e.g., "Codex" and "OpenRouter")

#### Steps
1. Open the app sidebar settings
2. Select "OpenRouter" provider — model list should show OpenRouter free models (e.g., `openrouter/free`, `google/gemma-3-27b-it:free`)
3. Select a model like `openrouter/free`
4. Switch provider back to "Codex"
5. Open the model dropdown

#### Expected Results
- Model list shows only Codex models (e.g., `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`)
- No OpenRouter models (e.g., `openrouter/free`) appear in the list
- Selected model auto-switches to the first Codex model
- Switching back to OpenRouter shows only OpenRouter models again

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No permanent changes needed
