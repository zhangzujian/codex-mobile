### OpenCode Zen Responses Payload Normalization

#### Feature/Change Name
OpenCode Zen `Responses` mode converts Codex Responses `input` payloads to Zen-compatible `messages` payloads.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. OpenCode Zen API key configured

#### Steps
1. Open Settings
2. Set Provider to `OpenCode Zen`
3. Set API format to `Responses`
4. Save
5. Select model `trinity-large-preview-free`
6. Send `hi`
7. Switch API format to `Completions`
8. Save
9. Select model `trinity-large-preview-free`
10. Send `hi`

#### Expected Results
- `Responses` mode posts to `/zen/v1/responses` with a `messages` payload derived from Codex Responses `input`
- `trinity-large-preview-free` returns a successful assistant greeting in `Responses` mode
- `Completions` mode still posts through `/zen/v1/chat/completions` and returns a successful assistant greeting
- Models unsupported by Zen for a chosen format, such as `minimax-m2.5-free` in `Responses` mode, surface the upstream error without being hidden

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider/API format back to preferred defaults
