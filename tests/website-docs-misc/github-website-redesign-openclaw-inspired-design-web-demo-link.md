### Feature: GitHub Website Redesign — OpenClaw-Inspired Design + Web Demo Link

#### Prerequisites
- The `docs/index.html` file has been updated with the new design.
- A browser is available to view the page locally or via GitHub Pages.

#### Steps
1. Open `docs/index.html` in a browser (local file or via GitHub Pages).
2. Verify the fixed **navigation bar** at top with brand logo, section links, and "Get the App" CTA.
3. Verify the **announcement banner** below nav shows the XCodex WASM link.
4. Verify **hero section** displays lobster emoji, "AnyClaw" title with gradient, tagline, and four CTA buttons: "Try Web Demo", "Google Play", "Download APK", "GitHub".
5. Click **"Try Web Demo"** button — confirm it navigates to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/`.
6. Verify the **stats bar** shows key metrics (2 AI Agents, 1 APK, 0 Root Required, 73MB, infinity).
7. Scroll to **Live Demo** section — verify embedded iframe loads `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/` with mock browser chrome.
8. Scroll to **Screenshots** section — verify four images render (2 desktop, 2 mobile).
9. Scroll to **Features** section — verify 6 feature cards in a 3-column grid.
10. Scroll to **Testimonials** section — verify two rows of auto-scrolling marquee cards (row 2 scrolls reverse). Hover to pause.
11. Scroll through **Architecture**, **Boot Sequence**, **Quick Start**, and **Tech Stack** sections — verify content renders.
12. Verify the **footer** includes a "Web Demo" link to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/`.
13. Test responsive at 768px and 480px — nav links collapse, grids single-column, buttons stack vertically.

#### Expected Results
- Page has a dark, premium feel with gradient accents, grain overlay, and smooth animations.
- All links to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/` work (announcement, hero CTA, demo section, quick start text, footer).
- Marquee testimonials scroll continuously and pause on hover.
- Embedded iframe demo loads successfully.
- Mobile responsive layout works at all breakpoints.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert `docs/index.html` to previous commit if needed.
