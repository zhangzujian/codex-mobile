### Feature: MCP elicitation requests and thread status labels

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository with a recent Codex CLI/app-server build.
- At least one configured MCP server can trigger `mcpServer/elicitation/request` or `item/permissions/requestApproval`.

#### Steps
1. Start a thread and trigger an MCP flow that asks for user input or permission approval.
2. Confirm the thread row status chip in the sidebar appears in English (`Awaiting approval` or `Awaiting response`).
3. Open the pending request panel for `mcpServer/elicitation/request`.
4. Confirm only the black pending-request panel is shown for the request; no duplicate yellow in-conversation request card should appear.
5. If the elicitation is `form` mode, verify the requested fields are rendered as inputs/selects/checkboxes based on the schema.
6. For a required form field that has no schema default, click `Continue` without answering it and verify the request stays open with a validation error instead of submitting a fabricated answer.
7. For an optional boolean or enum field that has no schema default, verify the control starts unselected rather than prefilled with `False` or the first enum option.
8. If the elicitation is `url` mode, verify an authorization link is shown only when the URL uses `http` or `https`.
9. Submit `Continue`, then repeat and verify `Decline` and `Cancel` are also available.
10. Trigger an `item/permissions/requestApproval` request and verify `Accept` and `Accept for Session` are shown instead of the generic fallback buttons.

#### Expected Results
- MCP elicitation requests no longer fall back to `Return Empty Result` / `Reject Request`.
- Pending requests are shown only once, in the dedicated black pending-request panel.
- Form-mode elicitation requests submit structured `{ action, content }` responses.
- Required MCP form fields without defaults must be answered explicitly before the request can be accepted.
- Optional MCP boolean/enum fields without defaults remain unset until the user chooses a value.
- URL-mode elicitation requests show an authorization link and submit a valid `{ action }` response.
- Non-HTTP(S) authorization URLs are not rendered as clickable links.
- Permissions approval requests submit proper permission grants with turn/session scope.
- Sidebar pending-request chips are displayed in English.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Decline or cancel the MCP request after verification, and close any opened authorization URL if it was only used for testing.
