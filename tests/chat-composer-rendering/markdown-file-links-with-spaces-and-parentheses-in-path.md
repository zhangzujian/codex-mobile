### Feature: Markdown file links with spaces and parentheses in path

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- An active thread is open.
- File exists at `/home/ubuntu/Documents/New Project (2)/hosting_manager.py`.

#### Steps
1. Send this exact message:
   `[hosting_manager.py](/home/ubuntu/Documents/New Project (2)/hosting_manager.py)`
2. In the rendered message, confirm it appears as one clickable file link.
3. Click the link and confirm it opens local browse for the full file path.
4. Right-click and use `Copy link`, then verify pasted URL still points to the same full path.

#### Expected Results
- Markdown link is parsed as one link token (not split at `)` inside the path).
- Clicking navigates to the full file path in local browse view.
- Copied link contains the complete encoded path.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove test file if it was created only for this verification.
