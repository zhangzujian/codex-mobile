### Content header actions remain right aligned

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread and new-chat header action buttons stay pinned to the right edge while long titles remain constrained and truncated.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. Sidebar collapsed or viewport wide enough to show content header actions
3. Terminal toggle available in the header

#### Steps
1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/`
2. Inspect the header row containing `Start new thread`
3. Verify the terminal toggle is aligned to the far right of the content header, not immediately after the title
4. Open a thread with a long title and repeat the alignment check
5. Confirm the title truncates with a tooltip and does not overlap the terminal or branch controls

#### Expected Results
- Header actions use the available right edge of the content header
- Long title truncation does not pull action buttons toward the center
- Terminal and branch controls remain visible and clickable

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove generated screenshots under `output/playwright/` if they are not needed
