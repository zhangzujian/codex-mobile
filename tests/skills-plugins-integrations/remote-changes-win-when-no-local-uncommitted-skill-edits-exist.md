### Feature: Remote changes win when no local uncommitted skill edits exist

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured with GitHub.
- Local skills repo working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain` empty under skills dir).
- Remote skills repo has newer commits touching existing skill files.

#### Steps
1. Confirm no local uncommitted changes in skills directory.
2. Trigger `Startup Sync` in Skills Hub.
3. After sync, inspect the skill file changed remotely.
4. Trigger `Force Refresh Skills` and confirm loaded skill content matches remote update.

#### Expected Results
- Sync pull/reconcile does not preserve stale local file content when local tree is clean.
- Remote updates are applied locally and remain after startup sync completes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.
