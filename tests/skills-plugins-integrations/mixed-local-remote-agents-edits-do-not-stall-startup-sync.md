### Feature: Mixed local+remote AGENTS edits do not stall Startup Sync

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured and working.
- Local skills repo clean before test start.

#### Steps
1. Add marker `A` to remote `AGENTS.md`.
2. Add marker `B` to local `AGENTS.md` before syncing.
3. Trigger `Startup Sync`.
4. Wait for startup status to finish (`inProgress=false`).
5. Verify sync outcome explicitly:
6. If sync succeeds, local/remote SHAs match and expected merged marker result is present.
7. If sync fails, status includes a concrete error message (not silent success).

#### Expected Results
- Startup sync must not report success while local remains behind remote.
- No stale stash side-effects are introduced (no unexpected conflict from old stash entries).
- Final state is either a valid synchronized result or an explicit failure status with actionable error.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Reset local skills repo to `origin/main` after test if needed.
