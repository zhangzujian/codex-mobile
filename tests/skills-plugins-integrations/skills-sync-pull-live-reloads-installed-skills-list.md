### Feature: Skills sync pull live-reloads installed skills list

#### Prerequisites
- App running from this repository with Skills Hub available.
- GitHub skills sync configured and connected.
- At least one skill update available in the sync source (new or edited skill metadata).

#### Steps
1. Open the app and note the currently visible installed skills for the active thread cwd.
2. In Skills Hub, trigger `Pull` from GitHub sync.
3. Wait for the pull success toast.
4. Without restarting the app/server, navigate to thread composer skill picker and verify the installed skills list.
5. Switch to another thread and back to force a normal UI refresh path.

#### Expected Results
- Pull completes successfully.
- Installed skills list reflects pulled changes immediately without app/server restart.
- Thread switch keeps showing the updated skills list (no stale cache rollback).

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- If needed, run another sync pull/push to restore previous skill state in the sync repo.
