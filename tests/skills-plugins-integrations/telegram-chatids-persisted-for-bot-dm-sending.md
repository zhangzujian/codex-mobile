### Feature: Telegram chatIds persisted for bot DM sending

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- Telegram bot already configured in the app.
- Access to `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.

#### Steps
1. Send `/start` to the Telegram bot from your DM.
2. Wait for the app to process the update, then open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.
3. Confirm `chatIds` contains your DM chat id as the first element.
4. In the app, reconnect Telegram bot with the same token.
5. Re-open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` and confirm `chatIds` remains present.

#### Expected Results
- `chatIds` is written after Telegram DM activity.
- `chatIds` persists across bot reconfiguration.
- `botToken`, `chatIds`, and `allowedUserIds` are all present in `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `chatIds` or delete `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` to clear persisted chat targets.
