### Feature: SkillHub shows detailed skill load errors

#### Prerequisites
- App running from this repository.
- At least one invalid installed skill file exists (for example unresolved merge markers in `SKILL.md`).

#### Steps
1. Open `Skills Hub`.
2. Trigger `Force Refresh Skills`.
3. Locate the `Some skills failed to load` panel above the skills sections.
4. Verify each row shows:
   - the failing `SKILL.md` path
   - the exact parser error message from app server (for example invalid YAML line/column details).
5. Fix the invalid skill file and trigger `Force Refresh Skills` again.

#### Expected Results
- SkillHub surfaces app-server load failures with detailed path and message.
- Messages are specific enough to identify the broken file and parser failure reason.
- Error panel disappears after invalid skills are fixed and refreshed.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Restore any intentionally broken local skill files used for testing.
