### Feature: Rollback appends rolled-back user text into composer input

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Open any non-home thread with at least one completed user/assistant turn.
- Composer input is visible in the thread view.

#### Steps
1. In the selected thread, locate a message row with a visible rollback action.
2. Click rollback for a specific turn whose user prompt text is known.
3. Observe the composer input immediately after clicking rollback.
4. If composer already had text, verify the rolled-back user text is appended on a new line.
5. Confirm the thread rollback still completes and the turn is removed from the conversation.

#### Expected Results
- Before rollback completes, the original user message text from that turn is inserted into the composer input.
- Existing composer draft text is preserved and the restored text is appended.
- Rollback behavior still removes the selected turn(s) as before.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear composer input if restored text is no longer needed.
