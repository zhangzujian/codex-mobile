### Feature: Rollback API/UI no longer requires turn index in rollback payload

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with at least 2 completed turns.
- Rollback control is visible in the thread conversation message actions.

#### Steps
1. Open any existing thread with multiple turns.
2. In DevTools Network tab, keep `/codex-api/rpc` requests visible.
3. Click rollback on a user or assistant message that is not the newest one.
4. Confirm rollback succeeds and the thread is truncated to the selected turn.
5. Inspect the UI event flow by repeating rollback from a different turn and confirm the selected message can rollback without relying on a numeric turn index.
6. Use dictation resend flow (or "rollback latest user turn" flow) and confirm the latest user turn is rolled back correctly.

#### Expected Results
- Rollback works when triggered from message actions using `turnId` as the identifier.
- No UI path depends on `turnIndex` in rollback event payloads.
- Latest-user-turn rollback flow still works and targets the latest user `turnId`.
- No TypeScript/runtime errors are introduced in rollback interaction.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert the updated files if this behavior is not desired:
  - `src/types/codex.ts`
  - `src/api/normalizers/v2.ts`
  - `src/components/content/ThreadConversation.vue`
  - `src/App.vue`
  - `src/composables/useDesktopState.ts`
