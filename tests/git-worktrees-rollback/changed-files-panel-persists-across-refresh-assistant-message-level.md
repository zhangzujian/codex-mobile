### Feature: Changed-files panel persists across refresh (assistant message level)

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- Existing thread in `TestChat` project with completed assistant messages.
- Worktree rollback auto-commit enabled.

#### Steps
1. Open a `TestChat` thread and confirm assistant message cards render.
2. Verify changed-files panel is shown at the end of assistant messages that have rollback commit data.
3. Hard refresh the page.
4. Re-open the same `TestChat` thread.
5. Verify changed-files panel is still shown for the same assistant message(s).
6. Expand one file diff and verify diff content loads.

#### Expected Results
- Changed-files panel is attached to assistant messages (not transient worked separators).
- Changed-files panel appears only once per turn (on the last assistant message in that turn).
- Changed-files panel is hidden while a turn is still in progress.
- Panels remain available after refresh/restart because lookup is turnId/message-hash based.
- File diff expansion still lazy-loads and displays content.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.
