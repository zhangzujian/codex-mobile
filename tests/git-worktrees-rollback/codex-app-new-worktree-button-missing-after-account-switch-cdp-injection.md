### Fix: Codex.app "New Worktree" Button Missing After Account Switch (CDP Injection)

#### Prerequisites
- `/Applications/Codex.app` installed
- Script at `scripts/fix-codex-worktree-button.sh` or `~/.codex/scripts/fix-codex-worktree-button.sh`
- Python 3 with `websockets` package (`pip3 install websockets`)

#### Root Cause
The Statsig SDK in Codex.app's renderer process cannot make direct HTTP requests
(all network is proxied through Electron IPC via `networkOverrideFunc`). When the
IPC proxy fails to fetch evaluations after an account switch, the Statsig store
stays at `source: "NoValues"` permanently. Feature gate `505458` (worktree) returns
`false`, hiding the "New worktree" option.

#### Steps
1. Open Codex.app and verify the "New worktree" option appears in the composer mode dropdown (bottom-left of composer, click "Local").
2. Switch accounts via profile dropdown (e.g. "Use Copilot account" or "Use OpenAI account").
3. Verify the "New worktree" option is now missing from the mode dropdown.
4. Run: `bash scripts/fix-codex-worktree-button.sh`
5. Script will:
   - Restart Codex.app with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled (`--remote-debugging-port`)
   - Connect via WebSocket to the CDP target
   - Inject gate `505458 = true` into the Statsig evaluation store
   - Clear the SDK memo cache and fire `values_updated` listeners
6. Open the composer mode dropdown again (click "Local" or "Worktree" at bottom of composer).

#### Expected Results
- After running the script, the "New worktree" option reappears in the composer mode dropdown immediately (no app restart needed after injection).
- Gate `505458` returns `true` from `checkGate()`.
- Use `--dry-run` to preview actions without making changes.
- Use `--port PORT` to specify a custom CDP port (default: 9339).
- If Codex.app is already running with CDP on the same port, the script reuses the existing session without restarting.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Quit and relaunch Codex.app normally (without `--remote-debugging-port`) to remove CDP access.
- The injected gate value persists only in memory for the current app session; restarting Codex.app resets it.
