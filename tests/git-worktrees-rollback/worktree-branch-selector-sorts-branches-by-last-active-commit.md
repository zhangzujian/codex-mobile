### Feature: Worktree branch selector sorts branches by last active commit

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Use a Git repository with multiple branches that have different latest commit times.

#### Steps
1. Open `New thread`.
2. Select the Git project folder.
3. Set runtime to `New worktree`.
4. Open the `Base branch` dropdown.
5. Note the first 3-5 branches shown.
6. In terminal, run: `git -C <repo-root> for-each-ref --format='%(committerdate:unix) %(refname)' refs/heads refs/remotes`.
7. Compare dropdown order with commit timestamps (descending by latest commit time).

#### Expected Results
- Branches are ordered by most recently active commit first.
- If a branch exists in both local and remote refs, it appears once.
- Ties are ordered alphabetically by branch name.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.
