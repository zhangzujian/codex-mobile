### User message edit action replaces rollback button

#### Feature/Change Name
The old rollback button is replaced with an `Edit message` action under each eligible user message, while keeping the existing behavior that appends the original text into the composer and rolls the thread back from that turn.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. An existing thread with at least one completed user/assistant turn

#### Steps
1. Open a thread with multiple completed turns
2. Hover a completed user message
3. Confirm `Edit message` appears under that user message
4. Confirm assistant responses no longer show the old `Rollback` button
5. Click `Edit message` on an earlier user message with recognizable text
6. Observe the composer draft after the click
7. Confirm the thread rolls back from the selected turn

#### Expected Results
- The action under eligible user messages is labeled `Edit message`
- Assistant responses no longer render the old rollback action
- Clicking `Edit message` appends the original user text into the composer
- The existing rollback behavior still truncates the selected turn and later turns

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Re-send the edited message if you want to recreate the conversation path
