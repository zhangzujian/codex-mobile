### Feature: Auto-commit default is disabled for new preference state

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- Browser local storage key `codex-web-local.worktree-git-automation.v1` is absent (new user state).

#### Steps
1. Open the app in a fresh browser profile (or clear only `codex-web-local.worktree-git-automation.v1`).
2. Open Settings and inspect the `Rollback commits` toggle state.
3. Confirm it starts in the disabled/off state.
4. Enable the toggle manually.
5. Reload the page and confirm the toggle remains enabled.
6. Disable it again, reload, and confirm it remains disabled.

#### Expected Results
- Default state is disabled when no prior preference exists.
- User-selected state persists via local storage across reloads.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.
