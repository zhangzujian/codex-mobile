# Entity: codex-web-local

## Summary
`codex-web-local` is a local fork/workspace for a Codex web UI and CLI wrapper (`codexapp`).

## Tech profile
- Frontend: Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript
- Backend bridge: Node + Express
- CLI output: `dist-cli/index.js` via tsup

## Operational characteristics
- Frequent branch merges into local `main`
- Strong conflict-resolution policy (intentional per-file merges)
- Manual regression documentation uses `tests.md` as the root index and domain folders under `tests/` for detailed test sections
- Integrated terminal uses a Node PTY bridge plus an xterm frontend for local/worktree threads
- Realtime chat rendering uses cached markdown/highlight output and bridge-side inline media sanitization to keep browser payloads bounded
- User-visible UI work is expected to include dark-theme verification, not only light-theme checks
- Worktree dev startup may reuse a shared `node_modules` tree; forcing reinstall is not always the right default
- Directory Hub is the `#/skills` surface for Plugins, Apps, Composio, MCPs, Skills search, and installed local skills
- Unauthenticated Docker startup can use OpenCode Zen as a runtime fallback, while an auth-mounted `CODEX_HOME` should switch back to the default Codex provider path without Zen flags
